    <h1>Ham and Cheese Breakfast Casserole</h1>

    <h2>
      Put ham, eggs, cheese and bread into one dish and you have the perfect morning wake-up call!
    </h2>
    <p>
      My obsession with harissa is real. Especially harissa mixed with coconut milk/cream! It’s such
      a flavor bomb. The creamy coconut milk balances out the spices in harissa so nicely. Needless
      to say, I’m hooked on this combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on what part of the country you're from, you might think of this as savory bread
      pudding, breakfast strata, or breakfast casserole.
    </p>
    <p>No matter what you call it, this hearty make-ahead breakfast has everything going for it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Butter (for the dish)</li>
      <li>1 loaf sliced white toasting bread</li>
      <li>8 small tomatoes, or 16 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>
        1 thick slice (3/4 pound) flavorful baked ham, cut into 1/4-inch dice (About 2 1/2 cups
        diced)
      </li>
      <li>10 large eggs</li>
      <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Butter a deep 9-x 13-inch baking dish. Cut the bread slices on a diagonal to make large
        triangles. Fit as many triangles as you can in the bottom of the dish, cutting smaller
        pieces to wedge between the larger ones, if necessary, to completely cover the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the bottom layer of bread with half the cheese. Lay half the tomato slices here and
        there over top, and sprinkle with half the ham. Add another layer of bread, again cutting
        smaller pieces, if necessary, to make a solid layer. Sprinkle with all but 2 tablespoons of
        the remaining cheese, and the remaining tomatoes and ham. Cover with a third layer of bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, beat the eggs, milk, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Pour the mixture
        carefully over the bread. With your hands, press the bread into the egg mixture. Sprinkle
        the remaining 2 tablespoons cheese over top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, or for up to 48
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 375°F. Take the dish out of the refrigerator and
        allow to come to room temperature for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the plastic wrap or foil and place on a baking sheet to catch drip. Bake for 55 to 60
        minutes or until it is puffed and golden brown and cooked through in the middle.
      </li>
      <li>
        A thermometer inserted into the center of the dish should register 160°F. If the casserole
        needs to cook longer, cover it loosely with foil and continue cooking for 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Let the casserole rest for 5 minutes before cutting into squares and serving.</li>
