    <h2>This quick and nourishing Spinach Tofu Scramble suits any meal, not just breakfast.</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve always enjoyed tofu, but I didn’t make tofu scrambles until I started dating a vegan. I
      still eat eggs, but on weekends, I now look forward to our easygoing late-morning breakfasts
      of tofu scramble with slices of well-buttered (or plant-buttered) toast. Don’t get locked into
      breakfast though—tofu scramble makes a speedy at-home lunch, or a handy weeknight dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of tofu scramble as a hearty yet healthy dish in its own right, and not a second-class
      stand in for eggs. Tofu scramble takes minutes to make, utilizes ingredients you have on hand,
      and is packed with protein.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 (about 1/2 cup) yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 pound firm or extra firm tofu packed in water, drained well</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon nutritional yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>4 cups loosely packed fresh spinach leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil; when it ripples, add the onion. Cook,
        stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use your fingers to crumble the drained tofu into bite-sized pieces. You can do this
        directly over the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, and turmeric, and stir to combine. Cook, stirring
        occasionally, until the tofu is hot, about 3 minutes. You’re not aiming to brown the tofu
        here, but if that happens a little, it’s not an issue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the spinach and cook until wilted, 1 minute. Sprinkle the lemon juice over the scramble.
        Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if needed. Leftover tofu scramble will
        keep in a tightly covered container up to four days. I don’t recommend freezing it.
      </li>
