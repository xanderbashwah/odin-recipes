      This one pan creamy harissa salmon in a flavorful coconut lime sauce is the perfect healthy
      yet quick and easy weeknight dinner.

    <p>
      My obsession with harissa is real. Especially harissa mixed with coconut milk/cream! It’s such
      a flavor bomb. The creamy coconut milk balances out the spices in harissa so nicely. Needless
      to say, I’m hooked on this combination.

      You can find harissa paste in most grocery stores. I get mine at Trader Joe’s – shocker, I
      know. But, you can also get it on Amazon. This one has great reviews. Note, a little goes a
      long way. Hence why my recipe only calls for 1 tbsp. However, you can taste your sauce before
      serving and if you think it needs more, add more! To clarify, not all harissa pastes are
      created equal so this is something you can adjust with taste.

      I’ve been eating more salmon since Butcher Box carries it! Their salmon is wild caught from
      Alaska. I find it hard to find affordable yet good quality salmon so this works for me. Salmon
      is so good for you. Most importantly, it’s so delicious when you add the right flavors!

      <li>1.5 tbsp olive or avocado oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Creamy Harissa Sauce</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup coconut cream from a can, make sure to get the thick part on the top</li>
      <li>juice and zest of 1/2 a lime</li>
      <li>1 tbsp harissa paste, can add a bit more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tsp grated ginger</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp cumin, or more to taste</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sliced green onion, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare your sauce by combining coconut cream, salt, harissa paste, ginger, garlic powder
        and cumin in a small mixing bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Season salmon filets with paprika and salt.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over medium high heat.</li>
      <li>Place salmon filets flesh side down in the skillet once it’s heated.</li>
      <li>Let cook for 4 minutes, then gently flip.</li>
      <li>Let cook about 2 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to medium low and pour sauce in the skillet with the salmon.</li>
      <li>
        Let cook 2-3 more minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakey. Use a spoon to
        keep mixing the sauce and pour some on the salmon so it absorbs the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>Right before removing from heat add the lime juice and zest.</li>
      <li>If adding sliced green onion, top it over salmon.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
